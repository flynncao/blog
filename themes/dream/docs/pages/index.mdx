# Quick Start

**_I assume you have already been browsed [Hugo Getting started](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/), if you want to use this theme, the docs will help you to understand configurations._**

## Create configuration file

Create `hugo.toml` if it doesn't exist in your blog folder.

<Callout type="info">
You can download this [default configuration file](https://github.com/g1eny0ung/hugo-theme-dream/blob/master/hugo.example.toml), including all params used in Dream.
</Callout>

## Add i18n Support

Open `hugo.toml` and write:

```toml
defaultContentLanguage = "en"
```

View [i18n](./i18n.md) for support languages and more details.

## Website Analytics

Dream support [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/) for website analytics.

In `hugo.toml`, set:

```toml
[services]
[services.googleAnalytics]
ID = "..."
```

<Callout type="warning">
You may have used `googleAnalytics = "..."` before. This is deprecated in Hugo `0.120.0`.

Please upgrade to the new configuration. See https://gohugo.io/methods/site/googleanalytics/ for more details.
</Callout>

## Social Comments

Dream can use [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) for social comments.

In `hugo.toml`, set:

```toml
[services]
[services.disqus]
shortname = "..."
```

<Callout type="warning">
You may have used `disqusShortname = "..."` before. This is deprecated in Hugo `0.120.0`.

Please upgrade to the new configuration. See https://gohugo.io/methods/site/disqusshortname/ for more details.
</Callout>

<Callout type="error">
Currently, Disqus does not support [oklch colors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/oklch) which is used in Dream.
We need to make an extra hack to make it work. See [Compatible with oklch colors](./social-comments.md#compatible-with-oklch-colors) for more details.
</Callout>

For more social comment systems, view [Social Comments](./social-comments.md).

```bash
hugo new about/me.md
```

Write somethings **about you**:

```md

```

```md
---
headless: true
