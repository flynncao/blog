# Summary Images

Each post can be associated with a cover image. This image will be displayed in the summary of the post in the home page:

```md
---
cover: /img/build-a-chrome-extension-with-figwheel-main.png
---
```

For a better visualization, it's recommended to set a cover image for each post (although it's not mandatory). I personally
go to [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) or [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) to select my posts' cover images (choose the small size).
