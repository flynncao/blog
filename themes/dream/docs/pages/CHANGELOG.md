### Major update in 2019-11-10

I completely rewrote the page layout to a [masonry layout](https://masonry.desandro.com/), and because of the site rewriting, I started to calculate the version again.

Correspondingly, the configuration (`config.toml`) has some breaking changes. Please refer to the documentation for details.
