I love Christopher Nolan's films. Inception and Interstellar are among the most intricate and mysterious sci-fi films. What would the biographical film directed by him be like?  The most fantastic experience Nolan gave me was mimicking the Oppie's imagination in the scene, sometimes like flames, particles, and rainbows. Most of the time, the atomics crash each other. 

Cillian Murphy is such a chill and talented actor. He starred as the boss of the family in Peaky Blinders, one of the best English dramas I've ever watched.

Are scientists all pacifists? I don't think political views should be imposed on these genii, but Oppenheimer and his former colleagues showed us how close he was to communism. I was surprised how Americans feared the spreading of communism and soviet power back in the 1940s even though they were facing more formidable enemies like Germany and Japan. That's the main reason he was investigated by intelligences after WW2 and was prosecuted by Rear Admiral Rear Admiral Lewis Strauss; I could never imagine Robert Downey Jr could undeniably be got into this character with his excellence; maybe the Oscar committee didn't like sci-fi and action movies as common folks do :).  Was Oppenheimer making atomic bombs to bring peace, as he said? Absolutely not, he is not Einstein by any means. 

Apart from that, there was also an interesting dialogue between Einstein and Oppenheimer:

Einstein: No? I left my country, never to return. The German calamity of years ago repeats itself - people acquiesce without resistance and align themselves with the forces of evil. You've served America well, and if this is the reward she has to offer perhaps you should turn your back on her.

Oppenheimer: Dammit, I happen to love this country.

Einstein:(considers this, nods slowly) Then tell them go to hell.

This movie's most impressive, unforgettable moment must be Oppie's speech after nuking Hiroshima and Nagasaki. I was shocked it partially recreated the obliteration of two cities by atomic bombs in Japan ... One hundred suns. After that when Oppenheimer wanted to leave, he was stumbled upon by a carbonised corpse. I watched the old Japanese animated movie [Barefoot Gen](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085218/), released in 1983..the non-fictional pictures that happened in history were more traumatising...What about the victims of the invaded country and Auschwitz then? Whoever killed them and what kind of fast, slow, humane, inhumane weapons they used doesn't matter in one way or another, the sorrows and hatred are scars of humankind. 





A curse of evolution.
