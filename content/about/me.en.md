Hey new friend! I'm Flynn Cao. In the tech world, you might label me as a front-end or full-stack developer. I play around with open-source projects now and then, but my main trajectory involves diving deep into my own ideas. I don't consider myself multilingual <a title="C1">EN</a>, <a title="B1">JA, </a><a title="native">ZH</a>, yet I am currently conducting my MSE research on linguistic area.
