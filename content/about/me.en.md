Hey new friend! I'm Flynn Cao. In the tech world, you might label me as a front-end or full-stack developer. I play around with open-source projects now and then, but my main trajectory involves diving deep into my own ideas. I never assert myself as a multilingual whereas I am currently doing my MSE research on this topic.
